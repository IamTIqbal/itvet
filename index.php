I am thrilled that you have decided to view our institute’s website in order to learn more about the wonderful students, faculties, and program we have to offer. Ahsanullah Institute of Technical and Vocational Education and Training was established in 1995 by Dhaka Ahsania Mission. Education builds a strong foundation for a nation and technology-based education is essential for a country like ours. Technical education is a very prospective field of education in our country. AITVET is maturing every year. Every academic year had been a notable one for AITVET in many respects.
    Today, the role of an educational Institute is not only to pursue academic excellence but also to motivate and empower its students to be life long learners, critical thinkers, and productive members of an ever-changing global society. AITVET has always been with them who believe in standard, the proper approach towards learning something and also to bring out the best.
    I have the perception to satisfy my trust and to put my effort eternally. I want to thank my team, my students and the guardians without whom this institution would never have come to this stage.<br></p>
